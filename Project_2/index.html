        <p>For my designs, I looked mostly at metrics that were most important for getting ready and preparing for conditions. For my first sketch, I wanted to display some of the most important topics in determing how to dress/what to bring. It shows the temperature, icon to represent the cloud coverage/precipitation, the chance of precipitation (over a period of time), and then recommends things to bring if necessary. For my abstract design, I wanted to do something that I also found relevant when driving. The main component that I thought about when driving was whether or not it was less than 32 degrees and consequently whether or not I had to be prepared for snow. I chose to show it by the simplest representation, of either being liquid water or ice.</p>
