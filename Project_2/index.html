        <p>For my designs, I looked mostly at metrics that were most important for getting ready and preparing for conditions. For my first sketch, I wanted to display some of the most important topics in determing how to dress/what to bring. It shows the temperature, icon to represent the cloud coverage/precipitation, the chance of precipitation (over a period of time), and then recommends things to bring if necessary. For my abstract design, I was inspired by the representation of change as depicted by the stock market. I love how clean it is in terms of the arrow representing the increase or decrease in stock, where it is currently, and what it has changed from. Thus, I compare humidity (HUM), temperature (TMP) and probability of precipitation (PRC) to the daily average.</p>
